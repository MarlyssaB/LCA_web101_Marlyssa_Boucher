                1. Today in class, I learned how to add an image to a web page. Through playing around with the CSS, I also learned how to change the background image, increase/decrease font size, change text and background color, and switch font families.
<P>2. I think coding is facinating because it feels so powerful. Computers are one of mankind's most incredible inventions, and I find it amazing that they can be controlled with just a few simple lines of code.</p>
<p>3. Doctype describes the type/version of HTML that the page will be using. The browser uses this information to decide how to render the page.</p>
<p>4. As a browser parses HTML, it constructs an internal document tree representing all the elements to be displayed. It then matches elements to styles specified in various spreadsheets according to the standard CSS cascade, inheritance, and ordering rules. The CSS engine evaluates each rule from right to left, starting in the key (rightmost) selector and moving through each selector until it finds a match or, failing to find a match, discards the rule. </p>

                1. Today in class, I learned how to create new files using commands in GitBash, as well as how to push my work into the cloud and publish it on the web. 
            <p>2. First, I write or sketch out a rough idea of how I would like my page to look. I then write out the page in HTML with no styling to ensure everything appears on the page in the correct locations. I then create the CSS, frequently saving and checking the live page to make sure everything comes together as I imagined it.</p>
            <p>3. Screen readers are software applications that read out the words and elements on a computer screen. They are most often used by people who are visually impared, have a learning disability, or are illiterate. ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications and is a way to make the internet more accessible to those with disabilities. It does this by changing how certain elements are read out by a screen reader so that the user better understands what is on the screen. For example, a checkbox without ARIA could be misidentified as a 'group'. With ARIA, it will be correctly identified as an unchecked or checked checkbox. Accessibility is important because it allows your site to be used by all users.</p>
